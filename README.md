# python-GUI-data-pipeline
Data Pipeline facilitated with GUI interface which is able to process multiple inputs such as CSV, spreadsheet, SQL DB, MySQL DB, PostgreSQL DB and outputs dtat to live table

This is a Python script that imports some modules from PyQt5 (a Python module that provides bindings for the Qt application framework) and pandas (a Python library for data manipulation and analysis), and three database connector modules for SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases. The script creates two classes, TableModel and TableView. TableModel is a subclass of pandas.DataFrame that implements the Qt model interface. TableView is a subclass of QTableView (a PyQt5 class for displaying tabular data) that sets the model and enables sorting and filtering.

When run, the script starts by displaying a dialog window to prompt the user to select a data source. The available sources are CSV, Spreadsheet, SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. If the user cancels the dialog, the script exits. Otherwise, the script loads the data from the selected source. If the source is CSV or Spreadsheet, the script displays a file dialog window to prompt the user to select a file. If the user cancels the file dialog, the script exits. Otherwise, the script loads the data from the selected file. If the source is SQL, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, the script prompts the user to enter the database credentials (host, user, password, and database name) and the SQL query to retrieve the data. If the user cancels any of the prompts, the script exits. Otherwise, the script connects to the database and retrieves the data using the SQL query. If an error occurs while connecting to the database or executing the query, the script displays an error message and exits. Once the data is loaded, the script displays it in a table view using the TableView class.

Finally, the script starts the event loop of the PyQt5 application and exits when the event loop is terminated.
